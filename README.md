# 🎙️ Audio Emotion Recognition Engine

A Deep Learning project that recognizes human emotions from speech using **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** and a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The system can classify emotions from audio files and perform **real-time emotion prediction using a live microphone**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Speech carries valuable emotional information. This project extracts acoustic features from speech recordings using **MFCCs** and trains a **CNN model** to classify different human emotions.

The trained model can also predict emotions from live microphone recordings, making it suitable for real-time applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract MFCC features from speech audio.
- Train a CNN model for emotion classification.
- Evaluate model performance using different metrics.
- Generate training graphs and confusion matrix.
- Predict emotions from live microphone audio.
